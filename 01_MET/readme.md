### Introduction
Since April the MET runs an exhibition named "The decorated Word — Writing and Picturing in Islamic Calligraphy" which shows stunning calligraphic artworks from the islamic civilization. 
On its website the MET introduces the exhibition with the sentence: "Calligraphy is a key achievement of Islamic civilization and arguably the most characteristic expression of the Islamic spirit." 
While elaborated calligraphy surely is a key achievement of the islamic civilization, _writing_ itself is definitly one of the most important key achievements of the humandkind. And it is an interesting and broad chimera of different elements, such as technology, art, code, cultural identity and more.  
Therefore, after visiting the rooms of the "Decorated Word" exhibition, I catched myself going through other exhibitions of the MET in search of _writing traces_ on the artworks. Paintings, vases, installations … which artworks gets along without writing? 
And which one contains an element of writing — any element — no matter if as a motive itself (calligraphy), as a description (picture caption), a label (signature) or content (poems)?

### Concept
Searching with the keyword "text" _(search?q=text)_ reveals around 10.000 items archived at the open access archive of the MET. 
All this items must be somehow related to the word _text_, for example through their titles, tags, classifications or descriptions.
Interesting questions to ask are:

**How many artworks are using text, compared to those which doesnt?**\
**What is the temporal development? — Artworks from which era contain the most/ the less text?**\
**Which cultures use most text in which era?**\
**How does the technique/medium of writing change over time?**\
**Are important historical incisions visible (e.g invention of movable letter, invention of paper,…) ?**\
**How does the technique/medium of writing change in different cultures?**\

### Design Approach
As the data visualisation deals thematically with _text_ in its broadest sense, the visual design might be inspired by the textural appearance, visuality and nature of text. 
The visualisation could be organised in a "textblock", readable from left to right. Furthermore it could use _text_ itself as an dataelement. 

### Outlook

But for the first time, men were experiencing the simultaneity of times and so breaking with their traditional time. By the very cable they were laying out, the news flow from Europe continued being sent from the cable station at Valentia. It kept them well informed about what was going on in the “outside” world. They arranged to get Greenwich Time given tot hem every morning through the cable in addition to a daily telegram giving them the general news of the day. In his diary, Gooch remarked that it was “wonderful to get, while in the Atlantic, the news of the morn- ing from The Times.” Moreover, as they moved further west, they began to receive the news “at breakfast, the same as people living in the next street to the Times office. As a result, they created a space of their own outside of their world, yet it was in congruence with the outer world. Not only did they follow Greenwich Time in their recordings, but they also used their connectivity for the continuation of news flows. News not only from Europe but from the entire world reached the small cable community via a combination of mail steamer and telegraph cable.«</h5>', {collapsed: false, position: 'topright', menuposition: 'topright', width: '20%', height: '100vh', delay: '17', icon: 'fa-info-circle'}).addTo(map);

A few hours steam brought the noble vessel to the entrance of Trinity Bay, where she was received by the British war steamer Porcupine, especially detailed for telegraphic service. Large icebergs were seen at a short distance from the land. As the little squadron approached the coast the British ensign was hoisted by the Niagara, and the stars and stripes by the Gorgon, the cable being slowly paid out as the vessels stood in towards the shore. At a little after two A.M., on the 5th of August, preparations commenced for landing the shore end. The Niagaras boats were lowered, and received on board about a mile and a half of heavy cable, which formed the shore end laid last year by the Niagara in Valentia Bay, and was taken up after it broke on the 11th of the month. Three hundred miles had been laid from the Niagara in 1857, a portion of which was recovered by "underrunning" from on board a stout raft or catamaran.«"  </h5>', {collapsed: false, position: 'topright', menuposition: 'topright', width: '20%', height: '100vh', delay: '17', icon: 'fa-info-circle'}).addTo(map);

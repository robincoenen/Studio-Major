var slideMenu = L.control.slideMenu('<h5> <b>8 years later</b> <br> Field, the same person who donated the artworks to the MET, was undaunted by the failure of the first cable. He was eager to renew the work, but the public had lost confidence in the scheme and his efforts to revive the company were futile. It was not until 1864 that, with the assistance of Thomas Brassey and John Pender, he succeeded in raising the necessary capital. The Glass, Elliot, and Gutta-Percha Companies were united to form the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Telcon, later part of BICC), which undertook to manufacture and lay the new cable. C.F. Varley replaced Whitehouse as chief electrician. <br><br><b>Repairing the cable</b><br>Broken cables required an elaborate repair procedure. The approximate distance to the break is determined by measuring the resistance of the broken cable. The repair ship navigated to the location. The cable was hooked with a grapple and brought on board to test for electrical continuity. Buoys were deployed to mark the ends of good cable and a splice was made between the two ends.<br>The new cable was laid by the ship Great Eastern captained by Sir James Anderson. Her immense hull was fitted with three iron tanks  and her decks furnished with the paying-out gear. <br> At noon on July 15, 1865, Great Eastern left the Nore for Foilhommerum Bay, Valentia Island, where the shore end was laid by Caroline. This attempt failed on July 31 when, after 1.062 miles (1968 km) had been paid out, the cable snapped near the stern of the ship, and the end was lost. <br>Great Eastern steamed back to England, where Field issued another prospectus, and formed the Anglo-American Telegraph Company,to lay a new cable and complete the broken one. On July 13, 1866, Great Eastern started paying out once more. Despite problems with the weather on the evening of Friday, July 27, the expedition reached the port of Hearts Content in a thick fog.<br><br><b>Using the old cable</b><br>In August 1866, several ships, including the Great Eastern, put to sea again in order to grapple the lost cable of 1865. Their goal was to find the end of the lost cable, splice it to new cable, and complete the run to Newfoundland. They were determined to find it, and their search was based solely upon positions recorded "principally by Captain Moriarty, R.N. There were some who thought it hopeless to try, declaring that to locate a cable 2.5 mi (4.0 km) down would be like looking for a small needle in a large haystack. However, Robert Halpin navigated HMS Terrible and grappling ship Albany to the correct location. <br> Albany moved slowly here and there, »fishing« for the lost cable with a five-pronged grappling hook at the end of a stout rope. Suddenly, on August 10, the Albany »caught« the cable and brought it to the surface. It seemed to be an unrealistically easy success, and that is how it turned out. During the night, the cable slipped from the buoy to which it had been secured and the process had to start all over again. This happened several more times, with the cable slipping after being secured in a frustrating battle against rough seas. One time, a sailor even was flung across the deck when the grapnel rope snapped and recoiled around him. Great Eastern and another grappling ship, Medway, arrived to join the search on the 12th. It was not until over a fortnight later, in early September 1866, that the cable was finally retrieved so that it could be worked on; it took 26 hours to get it safely on board Great Eastern. <br> The cable was carried to the electricians room, where it was determined that the cable was connected. All on the ship cheered or wept as rockets were sent up into the sky to light the sea. The recovered cable was then spliced to a fresh cable in her hold, and paid out to Hearts Content, Newfoundland, where she arrived on Saturday, September 7. There were now two working telegraph lines. </h5>', {collapsed: false, position: 'topright', menuposition: 'topright', width: '20%', height: '100vh', delay: '17', icon: 'fa-info-circle'}).addTo(map);
